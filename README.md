# Lando Norris Animation

A tiny little experiment inspired by the cursor animation on Lando Norris’ website.

## What This Is

So, I was scrolling Reddit and saw a post showing off the animation on the official Lando Norris site. Super smooth, super clean.
A few days later, Syntax uploaded this video trying to rebuild the effect:

Their attempt was cool, but I had this feeling that it could be done **way** simpler and lighter. So I tried building my own version—no frameworks, no heavy code, just CSS and a bit of vanilla JS.

## Why I Made This

Honestly? Mostly curiosity.
I wanted to see if I could get something that *felt* like the original but with:

* Less code
* Better performance
* Easier to drop into any project

It’s not a perfect clone, but it’s minimal, fast, and does the job.

## What You Get

* `index.html` – the a elements to manipolate
* `style.css` – a few lines of styling and animations
* `script.js` – only the logic to generate span from a element

Everything is intentionally simple.

## How to Try It

1. Download or clone
2. Open `index.html`
3. Move your mouse around and enjoy the little floaty guys

No build steps, no dependencies.

## Final Note

This was just a fun side project after seeing the original and the Syntax version. I’m pretty sure mine is a lot better :D
